                My name is Josh Campbell.  I am a Junior Experience Architecture major with minors in Computer Science
                Engineering and Graphic design at Michigan State University.
                My main interests lie in front end app and web development, focusing on the user interfaces.
                <br><br><span class="tab">
                Having</span> a minor in Computer Science Engineering gives me a better perspective of the technical
                aspects of developing apps and websites.  I originally had planned on getting my degree in Computer Science,
                but found that the focus on back-end development was far from what I wanted to do.

            <p class="indented">
                I decided to also get a minor in Graphic Design so that I have a better ability to design interfaces
                that are appealing to users.  Graphic Design is one area that I have had the least amount of experience with
                and earning a minor in it will be very beneficial to my future career.
                <br><br><span class="tab">
                I</span> have had two internships with Delphi which has been rebranded to Aptiv.  My first internship
                was what got me interested in front end development.  While working for Delphi, I developed an application
                using Java for the Android Auto operating system.  I was responsible for designing the layout and functionality
                of the buttons and menus, as well as the color scheme.  This was my first time working with developing from
                an IDE, not a template like wordpress.
                <br><br><span class="tab">
                Long</span> term I would like to either stay in the midwest area or relocate to Arizona or California.
                I see myself working for a design firm or in house design team for the first several years of my career,
                but would like to be in a management position or owning my own company once I have gained more experience.
