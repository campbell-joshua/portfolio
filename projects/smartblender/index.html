                For SpartaHack 2018, my friends and I decided to try to make a smart bread-maker out of normal one.
                We spent a long time working on the voice recognition and other features, but struggled with the actual
                hardware.  We ended up breaking the bread-maker after playing around with it for a few hours.  We then
                decided to try turning a $15 blender into a smart blender, using many of the things we had developed for
                the bread-maker.
                <br><br><span class="tab">
                Below</span> is the interface that we created for the voice recognition.  This was done using React and
                FireBase.  On the right is the blender that we used.
            </p>

            <p>
                The blender was much easier to work with than the bread-maker because unlike the bread-maker the blender
                only had 1 button.  We opened up the blender and spliced in a relay in place of the button.  Unfortunately
                this disabled the button.  Had we had more time we could have come up with a solution that would also allow
                the button to work.
                <br><br><span class="tab">
                The</span> main piece of hardware that was used was a Raspberry Pi.  This was used to host the
                <a href="https://voice-recognition-spartahacks.firebaseapp.com/">website</a> that was run through firebase.
                This allowed us to record the users voice, collect the phrase, and return it to the Raspberry Pi, which
                would then send a signal to the relay, controlling how long the blender was on for.  For example, if
                someone said "Run the blender for 30 seconds" the computer would collect "30 seconds", and set the relay
                to close the circuit.  After 30 seconds the relay receives another signal from the Raspberry Pi, telling
                it to open the circuit, thus shutting off the blender.
