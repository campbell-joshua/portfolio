    <p class="indented">The Rockford Ram Shack website was my first experience with
    front end development.  Beginning the project, I was a 16 year old Junior in
    high school, with nearly zero experience.  The Ram Shack website was designed to be a simple
    clothing store website for my high school's spirit wear.  The website that had been in place before
    I took over was very difficult to use.  Links were often broken, text was difficult to
    read, and the website just looked all around ugly.  I decided, rather than try to fix
    the train wreck, that I should just start from scratch.<br>
    <br>
        <span class="tab">
            Because</span> the majority of people working on the site after me would be other students,
    I decided to use WordPress.  This allowed any student after me to easily edit
    the website, rather than have a bunch of different teenage students try to learn HTML,
    CSS, and JavaScript.<br><br>
        <span class="tab">Before</span>
     beginning development, I started looking at other clothing store websites to gain
    inspiration.  A common theme I noticed across them was the use of the background.  They
    either opt for a white background or a soft color as to not distract the users eyes from
    the content.  I started to recognize patterns in menu structures and the general layout
    of the products.<br><br>
        <span class="tab">
            Once</span> I had figured out the main website layout and imported all of the updated content, I
    started work on implementing PayPal, allowing for online orders.  Fortunately, WordPress had
    a plugin for PayPal, I just had to implement it.  This proved to be more difficult than I had
    expected because the documentation for how to make "Pay with PayPal" buttons was not very clear
    and I was very inexperienced.  I gradually figured out how to include all of the necessary things
    such as payment, collecting shipping address, collecting contact information, and making sure the
    owner of the store was notified properly when a purchase was made.<br><br>
        <span class="tab">
            My</span> final challenge with the Ram Shack website was to understand GoDaddy and FTP.  While this was one
    of the most challenging parts, it gave me my first experience working with a server.  The website went live
    in the Spring of 2015 and I maintained it through the Spring of 2016, when I graduated.<br><br>
    <span class="tab">
        While</span> not everything on the website is my original design, much of the site reflects my original vision and
    design.  You can access the website by either clicking on the logo above or by following this link:
