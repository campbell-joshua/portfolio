            When I was 18, I built a Retro-Pi Arcade with my grandpa.  He did most of the physical and left the wiring and
            programming to me.  The arcade is designed to run emulators of any game developed before 1996.  The library of
            games is in the hunderds, and features classics such as Pac-Man, Super Mario Bros, Sonic, Donkey Kong, and many more.
            <br><br><span class="tab">
            Most</span> of the plans were pulled from a DIY website, with minor adjustments made for the specific hardware we used.
            I learned a great deal about hardware and wiring from this experience.

            The design of the exterior was taken after Michigan State and my Fraternity, Triangle.  The material used for
            the cabinet was particle board.  Looking back I would choose a different kind of material because particle board
            is very heavy and chips very easily.  The internal parts are composed of a set of buttons and joy sticks connected to
            Raspberry Pi.  There is also a LED light strip in the top, backlighting the Michigan State logo. The speakers are
            also located in the top compartment.
            <br><br><span class="tab">
            Another</span> feature of the arcade is the ability to plug in a controller to the front of the cabinet.  This
            allows me to play games with a PS3 controller that I keep inside the arcade.  This is especially nice for
            playing games for a long period of time.  This also allows me to play games with controllers that are more similar
            to the original controllers the games were developed for.
            <br><br><span class="tab">
            This</span> project took about 4 weeks from start to finish and cost around $300 to build.  Overall it gave me
            a much better understanding of the Linux operating system and how to manipulate a Raspberry Pi.
